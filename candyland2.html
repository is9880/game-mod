  <h2>Rules!</h2>
  
<p> 3-5 players required.  Recommended for ages 8 and up.
  <ol>
  1. Discern who the oldest player is.  They will serve as the moderator for the game.  Age is arbitrary because time is fake,
    however, and the player's may choose to use a different factor to select their moderator for any given session. Ultimately,
    just select a moderator from your group of players.<br><br>
    2. Once the moderator is chosen, they will pick two of the 6 colors featured on the <i>Candyland</i> board.  The first color 
    selected will subsequently send anyone who plays that card once to that same color.<br><br>
    3. The second color selected will send any player who plays that color back two same color spaces*.<br>
    *If a player plays a double card of that color they are sent back 2x the value of the normal detraction. i.e. If the second 
    color selected was purple and the player plays a double purple card, they will be sent back 4 purple spaces. <br><br>
    4. The goal of the game is to reach King Candy.  Players do this by "playing" colored cards that are dealt to them at the 
    beginning of the game.  Adhering to the above stipulations, any of the four colors not selected by the moderator send the 
    players to the next square of the color played.<br><br>
    5. Cards with two squares of the same color on them send you ahead two colored spaces. <br><br>
    6. Similarly, cards featuring the symbol for one of the Candy Locations send you to that spot.<br><br>
    8. At the beginning of the game the moderator shuffles all the cards and deals four cards to each player.  The players then 
    take turns strategically playing cards that allow them to move forward or backwards on the board, drawing another card at 
    the end of every turn.<br><br>
    7. On the occassion that two players land on the same square, the two players compete in a simple competition that the 
    moderator decides (typically another easy game such as rock, paper, scissors.) The winner of the competition then has the 
    option to
   <blockquote>
     a. Send the other player back 10 spaces or<br>
     b. Move ahead to the next Candy location on the board.
    </blockquote> 
    8. Stakes for winning and losing may be set at the moderator's discretion based on age of the players.  We recommend losing
    consequences to be things like "vaccumming responsibilities for a week" or "doing all the dishes" to "raise the stakes."
