  <p><i>Candyland</i> is the classic board game for children age 3-6.  Featuring 2-4 players, kids can journey through the 
  vibrant and sweet candy kingdom, racing to be the first to reach the candy castle.</p>
  <blockquote>
    I couldn't wait to buy this for my 3-year-old granddaughter since it was so well loved by my children and also my cousins
    and me way back when. It's very simple and straightforward, and I even enjoy playing it myself. The 3-year-old loves 
    getting out the game and discussing the pictures and screaming with joy when she gets a special treat card - even if it 
    sends her back to start! She doesn't quite get the concept of the game yet and is a little bored with just moving her piece,
    but she likes the idea of being able to play one-on-one with an adult and without her younger sister - who really at 18
    months just cannot be trusted not to mess it all up. We're working on the concepts of taking turns and following directions,
    and this is a good teacher. You only need to know your colors and how to count to 2! The only negative is the board design,
    although my granddaughter is fascinated with it. It seems too bright and busy and kind of distracting for a child who often 
    just wants to discuss the scenes. It's still bound to be a favorite, as expected, and we play at least once a day.
